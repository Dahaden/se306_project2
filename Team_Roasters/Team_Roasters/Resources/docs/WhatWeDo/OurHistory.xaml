        In 1978 a group of concerned parents together with health professionals, formed a small Auckland based committee looking at the special needs of children with cancer and their families.
From the small beginning, dedicated people established what is now a national organization which is made up of 6 regions Northern, Waikato, Mid-Northern, Central, Canterbury/West Coast and Otago Southland.  These regions support 22 branches around the country.
