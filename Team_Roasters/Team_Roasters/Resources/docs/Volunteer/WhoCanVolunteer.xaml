        CCF volunteers are ordinary people who come from a wide range of backgrounds and age groups. Some are parents, relatives or friends of families who have experienced the childhood cancer journey; some are from businesses and the public. Volunteers are interested in supporting our objectives, have a desire to support children with cancer and their families and help raise funds.
