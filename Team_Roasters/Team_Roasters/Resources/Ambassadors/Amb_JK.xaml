Jerome plays an enforcer on the field, but couldn’t be more of a family man and gentleman off-field. He has been generous with his time since joining the Foundation in March, 2012 and is a big hit with CCF children, he has met at fundraisers and events.  Jerome shaved his head for the 2012 Steve Price Night of Courage.
