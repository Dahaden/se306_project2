The former True Bliss, NZ Idol judge and Dancing with the Stars runner up Megan has always been known for her trademark braided hair and is even involved in her family’s hair braiding business. It was a mark of her commitment to CCF when she shaved her hair off at the Steve Price Night of Courage in 2012. Megan reformed TrueBliss in 2012 to write and launch a song especially for children with cancer, called “A Minute of One Day.”  She is always ready to step up and is frequently promoting CCF on television and radio.
