                Kieran is a well-regarded All Black forward, tipped by many to be the next captain.  Since coming on this year, Kieran has impressed with his can-do attitude, taking part in a promotion with More FM in Christchurch, during One Day for Child Cancer, where he could not talk about rugby in any form for a day, donating rugby memorabilia and making a popular visit to the Christchurch Farmers store which raised the most during the 2012 Annual Appeal.
